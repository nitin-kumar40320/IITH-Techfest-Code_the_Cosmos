Background Information
The universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion at current time. However, the expansion was not uniform throughout it’s history and we have evidence that the expansion of the universe was decelerating till few billion years ago when it started to accelerate. The rate of expansion of the universe is quantified by the Hubble Parameter. Hubble Parameter varies with redshift(proxy for time) and the variation is given by





Where
 and  are current density parameter of matter(non-relativistic) , curvature and dark energy respectively while  is the current value of Hubble Parameter and H(z) is the hubble parameter at redshift z. 


 


 is the critical density of the universe and is equal to  where is the hubble parameter at the respective redshift and is the density of ith component(i = matter, curvature etc). 


Problem Statement
Given a dataset for Hubble parameter at various redshifts, constrain and find the best fit values for  and   and plot 1 and 2D marginalized probability distributions for all three parameters and report uncertainty corresponding to 1,2 and 3 


* Take  =   
* Note that the dataset contains associated errors for Hubble Parameter. Include those errors in your analysis
